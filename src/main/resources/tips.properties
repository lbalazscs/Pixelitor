tip.2.description=<html>Each tool can be activated with a keyboard shortcut: the Move tool with <b>V</b>, the Crop tool with <b>C</b>, the Selection tool with <b>M</b>, the Brush tool with <b>B</b>, the Clone Stamp tool with <b>S</b>, the Eraser tool with <b>E</b>, the Smudge tool with <b>U</b>, the Gradient tool with <b>G</b>, the Paint Bucket tool with <b>P</b>, the Color Picker tool with <b>I</b>, the Shapes tool with <b>U</b>, the Hand tool with <b>H</b>, the Zoom tool with <b>Z</b>.

tip.4.description=Click on a color in the image with the Color Picker tool to make it the foreground color. Alt-clicking with the Brush/Eraser/Smudge tools has the same effect.
tip.5.description=Double-click a layer name to make it editable.
tip.6.description=Any tool behaves like the Hand Tool if you hold down the space bar before you start dragging. You can drag with the Hand tool to move the current view of a zoomed-in image. By releasing the space bar you return to the tool that was previously active.
tip.7.description=Holding down the space bar after you start dragging in the Rectangle/Ellipse selections and in the Shape Tool lets you move the whole shape.
tip.8.description=<html>Holding down the <b>Shift</b> key in the Move and Gradient tools constrains them to either vertical or horizontal movements.

tip.10.description=<html>You can set the foreground and background colors with the keyboard: <ul><li> the <b>D</b> key resets the default colors (black and white)<li> the <b>X</b> key swaps them<li> the <b>R</b> key sets random colors.</ul>
tip.11.description=<html>If you can't draw, check the following:<ul><li>the foreground color is not the same as the background of the image<li>there isn't a small selection somewhere (deselect with <b>Ctrl-D</b>)<li>the active layer is visible<li>the active layer is not hidden by another layer.
tip.12.description=In order to put an image into a new layer: (1) Copy the image to the clipboard (either from Pixelitor or from another program) (2) In Pixelitor use Edit/Paste as New Layer.
tip.13.description=Alt-drag with the Move tool moves a new copy of the current layer. (This might not work on Linux unless you reconfigure your window manager.)

tip.15.description=Click the layer icon to edit the layer, click the mask icon to edit the mask.
